# Team-Fortress-2-Aimbot
Aimbot for the game Team Fortress 2

Run the injector while TF2 is running.

I tried to avoid using too much of TF2's source code, so the only things copied from there are CBoneCache, matrix3x4_t, and ray tracing structs


Key binds:

Insert: exit

Tab: reset settings

Left Shift: aim bot

B: toggle between head shots and body shots

H: toggle between hold to aimbot and toggle

T: auto lock on to valid target

R: toggle ray tracing
